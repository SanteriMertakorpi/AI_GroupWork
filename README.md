## The Project

The goal of the project were to implement and test three Smart Meter Swarm Inteligence(SI) algorithms from [Paikrao & Bose, 2018](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243318.3243319).

Implementations of thease algoritms (Vector Based Algorithm, KLD Based Algorithm and Honesty Based Algorithm) can be found in the ```src``` folder in ```vba.py```, ```kba.py```and ```hba.py```.

## Testing the Algorithms

The testing implementation can be found in ```src --> main.py```.
To test the algorithms, we used anomaly data from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangrongsheng/ag_news).
